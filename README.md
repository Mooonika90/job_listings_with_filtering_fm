# Job Listings with filtering - Frontend Mentor Challange

This is my solution for FM Challange -  I've diligently worked on creating a landing page that aligns with the provided design requirements. I've ensured that users can filter job listings based on categories, experience a responsive design tailored to their devices, and interact seamlessly with all elements through hover and focus states.
